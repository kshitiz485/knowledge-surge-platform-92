  }
/>
```

### 5. Security Measures

## User Flow

1. User views available tests on the Tests page
2. User clicks "Start Test" on a test card

5. User can mark questions for review or clear selections
6. User submits the test when finished or when time expires
7. User is redirected back to the Tests page

## Styling

The test-taking interface uses a combination of:
- Tailwind CSS for layout and basic styling
- Custom CSS for specific components like the question status indicators
- Inline styles for dynamic elements

## Future Improvements

1. **Result Display**: Add a results page to show scores and correct answers after submission
2. **Progress Saving**: Implement auto-saving of progress in case of browser crashes
3. **Offline Support**: Add offline capabilities to handle internet connection issues
4. **Analytics**: Track time spent on each question for analysis
5. **Accessibility**: Enhance keyboard navigation and screen reader support
